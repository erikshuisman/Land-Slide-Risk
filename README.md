# TemperatureConversion
This repository was created for project 5 for SSCI 589 and contains a function that allows you to convert temperatures from celsius to farenheit or farenheit to celsius. Simply select which type of conversion you would like to make and then input the starting temperature. The converted temperature will then appear and you will have the option to convert another value or be done with the code.
